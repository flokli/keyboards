# keyboards
This contains firmware config for some of my keyboards.

Their firmware is accessible at the following attrpaths:

 - `keyboards.chocofi.firmware`
 - `keyboards.corneish_zen.firmware`
 - `keyboards.dilemma.firmware`

There's also scripts run the flashing commands. Check out `default.nix` in the
corresponding direcotires.

GH Actions also builds the firmwares in CI and uploads them as artifacts.
